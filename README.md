Hello, we are looking to update our company name, logo, and the link associated with our listing on 
this page here: https://k8smeetup.github.io/partners/. we are towards the bottom in the section called "Service Partners"

The company name was ReactiveOps.. It's now Fairwinds. Our short description should read: We are the Kubernetes Enablement Company. Fairwinds services, software and open source projects maximizes your investment in Kubernetes. We use Kubernetes best practices to help you manage your infrastructure to ensure security, efficiency and reliability.
